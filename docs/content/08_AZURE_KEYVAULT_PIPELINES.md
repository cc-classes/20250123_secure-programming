- **Secure Handling of Secrets**: Store API keys, database connection strings, and credentials securely in Azure Key Vault, preventing exposure in source code or pipeline configuration files.
- **Seamless Secret Access**: Azure DevOps Pipelines can automatically access secrets from Key Vault during pipeline execution, without needing manual intervention.
- **Audit and Monitoring**: Key Vault provides detailed logging and monitoring capabilities, allowing you to track access to secrets for compliance and auditing purposes.
- **Centralized Management**: Centralize the management of secrets, keys, and certificates, simplifying maintenance and ensuring consistent security practices across multiple projects.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Using Azure Key Vault with Azure DevOps Pipelines

#### Step 1: Set Up Azure Key Vault

1. **Create an Azure Key Vault**:
   - Log in to the **Azure portal**.
   - In the left sidebar, select **Create a resource**, then search for and select **Key Vault**.
   - Click **Create**, then provide the **name**, **subscription**, **resource group**, and **region** for the Key Vault. Click **Review + Create** to create the vault.

2. **Add Secrets to Key Vault**:
   - After the Key Vault is created, navigate to it in the Azure portal.
   - In the left sidebar, select **Secrets** and click **+ Generate/Import** to add a secret.
   - Provide a **name** (e.g., `MySecret`) and a **value** (e.g., `SecretValue123`), then click **Create**.

3. **Set Access Policies**:
   - Navigate to **Access policies** and click **+ Add Access Policy**.
   - Select the permissions you want to assign (e.g., **Get** for secrets), and specify who or which application should have access. For Azure DevOps Pipelines, you'll configure service connections to allow access.

#### Step 2: Set Up Azure DevOps Pipeline

1. **Create an Azure DevOps Organization**:
   - If you don’t already have an Azure DevOps organization, create one at [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/).

2. **Create a New Pipeline**:
   - In your Azure DevOps organization, navigate to your project and select **Pipelines**.
   - Click **New Pipeline**, and choose the repository you want to use (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos Git, etc.).
   - Choose either the **YAML pipeline** or the **Classic editor** for pipeline configuration.

#### Step 3: Connect Azure DevOps to Azure Key Vault

1. **Create a Service Connection to Azure**:
   - Navigate to **Project Settings** in Azure DevOps.
   - Under **Pipelines**, select **Service connections**.
   - Click **New service connection**, select **Azure Resource Manager**, and follow the prompts to authenticate using your Azure subscription.
   - Ensure that the service connection has the necessary permissions to access Azure Key Vault.

2. **Configure Key Vault Integration in Pipeline YAML**:
   In the pipeline YAML file, use the `AzureKeyVault` task to integrate Azure Key Vault with your pipeline. This task fetches secrets from Key Vault and makes them available as environment variables in the pipeline.

   Example YAML configuration:

   ```yaml
   trigger:
     branches:
       include:
         - main

   pool:
     vmImage: 'windows-latest'

   steps:
     - task: AzureKeyVault@2
       inputs:
         azureSubscription: '<your-service-connection-name>'
         KeyVaultName: '<your-keyvault-name>'
         SecretsFilter: '*'
         RunAsPreJob: true

     - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
       inputs:
         command: restore
         projects: '**/*.csproj'

     - task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
       inputs:
         command: build
         projects: '**/*.csproj'
   ```

   - In this example:
     - The **AzureKeyVault@2** task fetches secrets from the specified Key Vault.
     - The `SecretsFilter` allows you to specify which secrets to pull from the Key Vault (e.g., `*` for all secrets).
     - `azureSubscription` refers to the service connection created in Step 1.

3. **Access Secrets in Pipeline Tasks**:
   Once the `AzureKeyVault` task is executed, the secrets fetched from Key Vault are available as environment variables in subsequent pipeline tasks. For example, if you have a secret called `MySecret`, you can access it like this in a later task:

   ```yaml
     - script: echo $(MySecret)
       displayName: 'Display Secret Value'
   ```

   This will print the value of `MySecret` stored in Key Vault.

#### Step 4: Secure the Pipeline

1. **Limit Secret Access**:
   Use Azure DevOps RBAC and **Azure Key Vault Access Policies** to limit who can access the Key Vault and its secrets. This follows the principle of least privilege.

2. **Audit Access to Secrets**:
   Enable **Azure Monitoring** and **Azure Security Center** to audit and monitor access to the Key Vault. This helps in tracking who accessed the secrets and when, which is critical for compliance and security purposes.

#### Step 5: Run the Pipeline

After setting up your pipeline with the `AzureKeyVault` task and secret integration, trigger the pipeline run. Azure DevOps will fetch the secrets from the configured Key Vault and use them as part of the build and deployment process.

- Go to **Pipelines**, select your pipeline, and click **Run Pipeline**.
- Monitor the run, and ensure that the secrets are accessed securely from Key Vault and used in the tasks.
